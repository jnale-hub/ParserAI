# ParserAI

A common task in natural language processing is parsing, the process of determining the structure of a sentence. This is useful for a number of reasons: knowing the structure of a sentence can help a computer to better understand the meaning of the sentence, and it can also help the computer extract information out of a sentence. In particular, itâ€™s often useful to extract noun phrases out of a sentence to get an understanding for what the sentence is about.
